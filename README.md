🛠️ Daily Coding Practice & LeetCode Challenges
Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my coding journey. This repository is my digital playground where I tackle coding problems daily, primarily from LeetCode, and sharpen my skills for technical interviews and exams.

📂 What's Inside?
Daily LeetCode Challenges: Every day, I solve at least one problem from LeetCode. You'll find these solutions neatly organized by date, so you can follow along with my progress or revisit specific days.
Additional Practice Problems: Beyond daily challenges, I dive into other coding problems to reinforce my understanding of different concepts. These are grouped by topics like arrays, strings, dynamic programming, and more.
🚀 Why This Repo?
Consistency: Coding is a muscle, and I’m here to flex it daily. This repo keeps me accountable.
Growth: By sharing my journey, I hope to help others learn, too. Feel free to explore the code, learn from it, or even critique it!
Community: Got a better solution? An optimization tip? Or just want to chat about a problem? Your contributions and discussions are more than welcome.
🤝 How You Can Join In
Explore: Check out the code and see how I approach different problems.
Contribute: Found a bug or have a better solution? Pull requests are always appreciated.
Connect: Coding is better together! Let’s connect, share knowledge, and grow as developers.
